Here are some scripts I've written for use with Reaper DAW

- half-speed (LUA)

Changes an item's playback speed to be half what it current is. Also adjusts the item length accordingly.
Works with both audio and MIDI

- double-speed (LUA)

Changes an item's playback speed to be double what it current is. Also adjusts the item length accordingly.
Works with both audio and MIDI
